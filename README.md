## Preface

GIFT (Global Interdisciplinary Food Technologies) Knowledge Repository is a data curation and analysis app allowing scholars from any field relating to food sustainability issues to upload data, link to previously exisiting collections, and perform mass aggregates.

## Pre-Configuration

**OSX Pre-Configuration**
``` shell
# Brings up dialog to download & install X-Code's minimal command-line tools
@host $ xcode-select --install
# Issue command to d/l and install OSX's package manager, Homebrew
@host $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# Homebrew to install NodeJS and Node Package Manager (npm)
@host $ brew install node
# Homebrew Cask to install the VirtualBox VM and Vagrant VM Manager
@host $ brew cask install virtualbox vagrant
# Homebrew to install Ansible provisioning for the VM
@host $ brew install ansible
```

**Ubuntu Pre-Configuation**
``` shell
# Install legacy nodejs (for ubuntu) and npm
@host $ sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
# If the command below fails, download virtualbox and vagrant from the web
@host $ sudo apt-get install virtualbox vagrant
@host $ sudo apt-get install ansible
```

**All systems**
``` shell
# Node Package Manager to install Yeoman Scaffolding tool
@host $ sudo npm install -g yo generator-djangular-gift
# Ansible's Galaxy to download pre-defined provisioning roles
@host $ ansible-galaxy install -r provisioning/requirements.yml
```

Navigate to where you want to create the project directory...
``` shell
# Clones the Github repository to your local machine
@host $ git clone https://github.com/thePortus/usf-gift
@host $ cd usf-gift
@host $ vagrant up
```

Vagrant will now start the virtual machine and begin provisioning it. You will likely be asked to enter your password after several minutes. This portion may take a long time on slower machines.

Ansible will then install several package managers (nodejs, npm, bower, & pip) which we will use to install all of our application's dependencies. Once it is finished, you will be back at the command line prompt.

## Setting Up the VM

Now that the machine is operating, time to connect and configure. The next commands will connect you and take you to the folder inside the VM that is synced with the the project directory on your host machine.
``` shell
# Connect to the VM from your host machine through ssh as user dev0
@host $ vagrant ssh dev0
# Change to the /vagrant directory (which is the synced repo folder)
@dev0 $ cd /vagrant
# Activate development environment
@dev0 $ source bin/activate
```

Next, install your server and client-side dependencies with npm and bower.
``` shell
# Install server-side dependencies on vm with npm (include bower dependencies)
@dev0 $ npm install
```

Time to set up the PostgreSQL server. You will temporarily switch into the 'postgres' user mode, create the database and then enter into its shell.
``` shell
# Sudo as postgres user
@dev0 $ sudo -i -u postgres
# Create development database 'gift_dev' as postgres
@postgres $ createdb gift_dev
# Launch into the PostgreSQL shell
@postgres $ psql
```

Now you are inside the postgres shell. Lets create our apps credentials and grant it privileges.
``` sql
# Create new credentials
@ psql $ CREATE ROLE vagrant WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'vagrant';
# Give new user 'vagrant' all priveleges on the development db
@ psql $ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE gift_dev TO vagrant;
# Change create of 'gift_dev' to 'vagrant'
@ psql $ ALTER USER vagrant CREATEDB;
# Quit the PostgreSQL shell and then exit out of postgres
@ psql $ \q
@ postgres $ exit
# You should now be back inside the ssh of your VM, as dev0
```

Now to install Python dependencies and migrate the initial models.
``` shell
# Use pip to read and d/l project module dependencies
@dev0 $ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
# Migrate over the default models (auth, etc...)
@dev0 $ python manage.py migrate
```

If everything has worked, run testing, build css, and start the server.
``` shell
# Grunt task-runner performs automated testing with karma/protractor
@dev0 $ grunt test
# Convert sass to css
@dev0 $ grunt sass translate
# Compile static files and start the server
@dev0 $ grunt serve
```

That's it! You should (hopefully) be able to go to your [localhost (http://localhost:9000)](http://localhost:9000) on your browser to see the splash page.

You can exit the VM on the terminal by typing `exit`. To shut the VM down and free memory, exit the VM, and then while in the project directory, type either of the following.
``` shell
# Shuts down the VM (execute from host machine, in project directory)
@host $ vagrant halt
# Once you halt, suspend frees up system memory (use vagrant up to restart)
@host $ vagrant suspend
# After you halt and/or suspend the VM, you can free up space by removing it
@host $ vagrant destroy
```
